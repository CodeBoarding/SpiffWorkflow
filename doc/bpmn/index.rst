SpiffWorkflow and BPMN
======================

All the Python code and BPMN models used here are available in an example
project `spiff-example-cli <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli>`_

This example application serves two purposes:

- to illustate what a developer will need to do to use this library
- to let library users experiment without fully building out their own system
